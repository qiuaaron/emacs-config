# dts-mode â€” A devicetree major mode for emacs

This is a quick attempt at getting basic highlighting for
[devicetree][] syntax in emacs. While it's fairly functional, it's not
pretty; pull requests welcome.

## Installation

Available through [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/). Alternatively ensure `dts-mode.el` is available in `load-path` and `(require 'dts-mode)`.
